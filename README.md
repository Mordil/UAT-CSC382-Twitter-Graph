# UAT-CSC382-Twitter-Graph
One of [University of Advancing Technology's](http://www.uat.edu/) "Data Structures and Algorithms" (CSC382) course weekly assignment.

Basic implementation of a data structure representing a Twitter User, and a Twitter Data cluster of users with different relationships.

The intention is to utilize a [`Binary Tree`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree) data structure in C++ with supporting methods for adding, removing, and finding nodes of users with followers & subscribers.

There was also a requirement for calculating the shortest distance between two given nodes.

## Course Description

> This course explores the specification and implementation of containers as abstract data types. Structures covered include strings, vectors, stacks, queues, sequential lists, binary trees, hashes and graphs. The course also investigates algorithm design and evaluation, such as sorting, search, recursion and algorithmic analysis. Students will use concepts from calculus within this course.
